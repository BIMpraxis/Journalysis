# Journalysis
Revit journal analysis package for Dynamo (in development, not yet published on the Dynamo package manager)

This is still very much a work in progress and there is hardly any documentation except the [Class & Node Overview](https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis/wiki/Class-&-Node-Overview) (which may not always be up-to-date).

# Goal
This package is aimed at automating the analysis of Revit journals for statistical purposes. Some possible use cases:
- Monitor crashes
- Monitor API errors
- Monitor memory usage
- Monitor sync with central duration
- Keyboard shortcut usage
