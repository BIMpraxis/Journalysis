**Journalysis** is a Revit journal and worsharing log analysis package for the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.com) visual programming environment. It will be published on the Dynamo package manager in early 2019. It is currently being developed in Dynamo 1.3 and has not been tested with Dynamo 2.x.

# Documentation
This is still very much a work in progress. Since there is hardly any documentation on Revit journals, it is a slow process. I have started writing some documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis/wiki) that may, however, not always be up-to-date.

# Goal
This package is aimed at automating the analysis of Revit journals for statistical purposes. Some possible use cases:
- Monitor crashes
- Monitor API errors
- Monitor memory usage
- Monitor sync with central duration
- Keyboard shortcut usage
