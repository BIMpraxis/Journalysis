# Journalysis
Revit journal and worsharing log analysis package for Dynamo (in development, not yet published on the Dynamo package manager)

This is still very much a work in progress. Since there is hardly any documentation on Revit journals, it is a slow process. I have started writing some documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis/wiki) that may, however, not always be up-to-date.

# Goal
This package is aimed at automating the analysis of Revit journals for statistical purposes. Some possible use cases:
- Monitor crashes
- Monitor API errors
- Monitor memory usage
- Monitor sync with central duration
- Keyboard shortcut usage

# Contribute
If you're interested in helping with this project, I welcome the following types of contributions:
- Code
- Journals (in particular those with spectacular crashes)
- Worksharing logs
- Use cases
- Data that should be mined from a journal but is not yet supported by any of the nodes
