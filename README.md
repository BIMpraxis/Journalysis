**Journalysis** is a Revit journal and worsharing log analysis package for the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.com) visual programming environment. It will be published on the Dynamo package manager in early 2019. It is currently being developed in Dynamo 1.3 and has not been tested with Dynamo 2.x.

## Updates
Since Dynamo's package manager currently does not (yet) have an update notification infrastructure in place, you may want to follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/a_dieckmann) for update notifications.

# Documentation
This is still very much a work in progress. Since there is hardly any documentation on Revit journals, it is a slow process. I have started writing some documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis/wiki) that may, however, not always be up-to-date.

# Goal
This package is aimed at automating the analysis of Revit journals for statistical purposes. Some possible use cases:
- Monitor crashes
- Monitor API errors
- Monitor memory usage
- Monitor sync with central duration
- Keyboard shortcut usage

# Contribute
If you're interested in helping with this project, I welcome the following types of contributions:
- Code
- Journals (in particular those with spectacular crashes)
- Worksharing logs
- Use cases
- Data that should be mined from a journal but is not yet supported by any of the nodes
